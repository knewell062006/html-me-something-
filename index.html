        In 2017 I decided to move back home to the bay area, to chase my dreams of getting into the tech industry. 
    <br>What I thought I was going for, and what I actually left with, was far greater than I could've ever Imagined.

      When I arrived In Sf I thought I would be entering an apprenticeship for PG&E to become an electrician, <br>
      instead I ended up doing my old job making deliveries.

      That was until I interviewed to become the opening manager of The Bay Club. <br>
      This job was the best! It also came with a ton of responsibliity.
